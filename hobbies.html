    <h4>Playing Rugby</h4>
    <p>I've been playing rugby for 16 years, and I moved to Berlin to continue playing, but in a different environment.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Walking with my dog</h4>
    <p>my girlfriend and I have a Podenco, a spanish hunting dog, much like a greyhound just a little bigger. She is called Fina
    it means fine or dainty in spanish. We love to take her out on long walks to the forests where she can run around freely</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Coffee Breaks</h4>
    <p>I've been a specialty coffee barista for 2 years now, so coffee is a given.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Learning new skills</h4>
    <p>just like here, i'm learning to code websites from the beginning. I think it is an interesting subject, and certainly a good skill to learn</p>
